========================
Changes in version 1.0.2
========================

Bugfixes
========

* :issue:`258`: Bugfix to a previous, incorrectly applied fix regarding
  `~fabric.operations.local` on Windows platforms.
* :issue:`324`: Update `~fabric.operations.run`/`~fabric.operations.sudo`'s
  ``combine_stderr`` kwarg so that it correctly overrides the global setting in
  all cases. This required changing its default value to ``None``, but the
  default behavior (behaving as if the setting were ``True``) has not changed.
  Thanks to Matthew Woodcraft and Connor Smith for the catch.
* :issue:`337`: Fix logic bug in `~fabric.operations.put` preventing use of
  ``mirror_local_mode``. Thanks to Roman Imankulov for catch & patch.


Documentation
=============

* Updated the API documentation for `~fabric.context_managers.cd` to explicitly
  point users to `~fabric.context_managers.lcd` for modifying local paths.
* Clarified the behavior of `~fabric.contrib.project.rsync_project` re: how trailing slashes in ``local_dir`` affect ``remote_dir``. Thanks to Mark Merritt for the catch.
